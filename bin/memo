#
# memo(1), memoizes the output of your command-line, so you can do:
#
#  $ memo <some long running command> | ...
#
# Instead of
#
#  $ <some long running command> > tmpfile
#  $ cat tmpfile | ...
#  $ rm tmpfile
#
# You can even use it in the middle of a pipe if you know that the input is not
# extremely long. Just supply the -s switch:
#
#  $ cat sitelist | memo -s parallel curl | grep "server:"
#
# As long as "sitelist" isn't changed, the curl(1) invocation will not be rerun.
#
# Memo provides some nice to haves, like transparant (de)compressing of the
# output so you're less likely to be disk I/O bound and save some space. The
# order of preferred compression algorithms is: lz4, xz, gzip. If none of these
# programs are present on the system, the output is stored uncompressed.
#
# If you think this is handy, you're right. Yet, there are good reasons why this
# sort of tool isn't distributed by default on distributions: it can give
# surprising effects. Suppose the <command> you're trying to memoize depends on
# the current working directory. Changing the directory and running the same
# memo invocation will now paste the wrong data to stdout. Use this only if you
# know what it's doing.
#
# That said, I use it a lot, I really can't be bothered to create arbitrarily
# named temporary files all the time when I'm grabbing output from some slow
# networked program. Additionally, memo transparantly compresses.
#
# If you want to memo'ize shell functions, then you can source this script
# instead of executing it. This will define a function called memo() that you
# can use in exactly the same way. It made the implementation much uglier, but
# at least I can memo'ize functions.
#
# Don't let the /bin/bash shebang at the top fool you, it runs just fine in zsh.

# Detect being sourced from zsh and bash.
